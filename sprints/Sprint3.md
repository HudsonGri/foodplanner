## Sprint 2

### Work that we have completed in Sprint 3

Frontend
- ...

Backend
- This sprint, the backend team tackled several tasks. First, we updated Go and our database to accommodate two new columns for storing JSON data related to a user's recipe choices and our calculated recipes. We also expanded our testing efforts in Go to include changing specific user preferences. In addition, we focused on improving the Flask API, which calculates recipes based on a user's preferences and ingredient overlaps. We also helped integrate these additions into the frontend for users to easily view.
